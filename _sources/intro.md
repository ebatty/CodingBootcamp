# Introduction

Welcome to the course site for the SURFIN Coding Bootcamp!

## Course description
Coding and quantitative skills have become increasingly indispensable tools in modern neuroscience research. This boot camp aims to empower SURF fellows in their research endeavours by equipping them with these skills. Students will learn the basics of Python coding, focusing on the principles and packages most useful for neuroscientists and completing exercises involving neuroscience data and analyses. Computational thinking skills will be incorporated throughout the boot camp. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this boot camp, students will be able to:
*   Write Python code for research, using both basic coding concepts such as conditionals and loops and scientific packages such as numpy and matplotlib
*   Visualize neural data and compute summary statistics
*   Know of resources to keep learning and practicing coding and quantitative skills, and have the confidence to do so

## Prerequisites

This boot camp will assume no prior knowledge of coding or Python.
