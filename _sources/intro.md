# Introduction

Welcome to the course site for the SURFIN Coding Bootcamp!

## Course description
Coding and quantitative skills have become increasingly indispensable tools in modern neuroscience research. This boot camp aims to empower SURF fellows in their research endeavours by equipping them with these skills. Students will learn the basics of Python coding, focusing on the principles and packages most useful for neuroscientists and completing exercises involving neuroscience data and analyses. Computational thinking skills will be incorporated throughout the boot camp. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this boot camp, students will be able to:
*   Write Python code for research, using both basic coding concepts such as conditionals and loops and scientific packages such as numpy and matplotlib
*   Visualize neural data and compute summary statistics
*   Know of resources to keep learning and practicing coding and quantitative skills, and have the confidence to do so

## Prerequisites

This boot camp will assume no prior knowledge of coding or Python. 

## Structure

This bootcamp will take place over five weeks, with a two hour live session each week. Before live session on Thursday, students will watch prerecorded videos on their own time (max 30-45 minutes a week) and submit answers to comprehension questions. During the live sessions, we will interactively review and practice the coding concepts introduced in the videos. Students will work together in small groups on programming exercises, often incorporating neural data or neural applications, with help from the instructor and TAs. After the live session, students are expected to complete and submit each week's exercises to receive feedback. Most of the exercises should be completed during the live session but there may be some remaining that the students need to complete on their own.

Throughout each week, there will be several help sessions/office hours hosted by TAs and the instructor on zoom (zoom link the same as live sessions, check slack/email):

*  Mondays at 6 pm EST (with Katrina)
*  Tuesdays at 9 am EST (with Ella)
*  Thursdays at 1 pm EST (with Destinee)

## Expectations of students

By Thursday each week, students will submit the weekly exercises from the previous week, watch the videos for that week, and submit comprehension questions. Students are expected to attend the live sessions if at all possible. In the case of time zone/schedule conflicts, students should still complete and submit the comprehension questions and weekly exercises, and attend one of the  help session/office hours that week.

## Schedule

* Notes that listed topics highlight Python competencies but computational thinking will be incorporated throughout
